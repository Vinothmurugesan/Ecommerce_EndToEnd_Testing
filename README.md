# Ecommerce_EndToEnd_Testing
I developed a Selenium C# automation testing framework using Page Object Model (POM), PageFactory, and data-driven testing with JSON and TestCaseSource. It supports parallel execution, Extent Reports, Jenkins integration, thread-safe WebDriver, and parameterized test execution, making it efficient and scalable.
